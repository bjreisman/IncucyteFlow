\title{Create channel description mapping for Incucyte data}
\usage{
create_channel_desc(FLR1 = "FLR1", FLR2 = "FLR2", FLR3 = "FLR3")
}
\arguments{
\item{FLR1}{Description for FLR1 channel (e.g., "GFP", "Phase")}

\item{FLR2}{Description for FLR2 channel (e.g., "TMRM", "mCherry")}

\item{FLR3}{Description for FLR3 channel (e.g., "Sytox Deep Red", "Annexin")}
}
\value{
Named vector of channel descriptions
}
\description{
Creates a named vector mapping Incucyte channel names to human-readable
descriptions for use in FCS file metadata.
}
\examples{
# Default descriptions
desc <- create_channel_desc()

# Custom descriptions
desc <- create_channel_desc(FLR1 = "GFP", FLR2 = "TMRM", FLR3 = "Sytox Deep Red")
}
